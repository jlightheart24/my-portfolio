            <p>My name is Jonathan Lightheart. I currently work as a Registered Behavior Technician for Utah Behavior Services where I have been.
                employed for two years. I work one on one with children with Autism
                </br>
                I am currently studying to become a full stack web developer. I am working towards a certificate with the University of Utah with
                their coding bootcamp. My goals are to work as such at the beginning of next year. I want to be on the fore-front of web developers
                and plan to continue to increase my knowledge and education in the field.
